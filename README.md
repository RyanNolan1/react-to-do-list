## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a ton about ReactJS whilst making this project, focusing on:

- Utilising useState and lifting up state
- Structuring Components for better organisation 
- Using props efficiently
- Using the Ternary Operator for conditional rendering

### Continued development

In the future I will continue to practice using useState, useEffect, Components and Ternary Operators.
